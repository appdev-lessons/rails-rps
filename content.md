# Rails: Rock, Paper, Scissors

---

[Here is a video for this lesson](https://share.descript.com/view/1Sr0ltQAKFo).

In this project, you will rebuild the simple game Rock, Paper, Scissors game that you made in Sinatra; this time using Rails.

Here is your target: [rps.matchthetarget.com](https://rps.matchthetarget.com/)

This project includes automated tests, so click on this button to get started:

LTI{Load Rails RPS assignment}(https://grades.firstdraft.com/launch)[S9ymPy6WCsn18gLbByVbZQ7k]{vfdtzJb5bLYqYwuqgeRKpc5d}(10)[Rails RPS Project]

Then, fork the repository and create your codespace.

You can use the code from Sinatra Rock, Paper, Scissors to match the target; but it will need to be rewritten in the Rails framework. You should also keep the [RCAV Flowchart lesson handy](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/120-rcav-flowchart); it's a good reference for building Rails routes.

When you think you have the target matched, run `rake grade` to get automated feedback.
